# Python NLTK Corpus

In linguistics, a corpus (plural corpora) or text corpus is a large and structured set of texts. In corpus linguistics, they are used to do statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, checking occurrences or validating linguistic rules within a specific language territory.

Each corpus reader class is specialized to handle a specific corpus format. In addition, the nltk.corpus package automatically creates a set of corpus reader instances that can be used to access the corpora in the NLTK data package.
