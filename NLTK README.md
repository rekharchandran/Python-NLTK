# NLTK Introduction 
The Natural Language Toolkit, or more commonly NLTK, is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing (NLP) for English written in the Python programming language( Source: Wikipedia)

NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.  It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning.

NLTK contains useful tools for text preprocessing and corpora analysis. You do not need to create your own stop words list or frequency function for every NLP project. NLTK saves you time so that you can focus on your NLP tasks instead of rewriting functions.
